# Beginnings

It started with just a postcard of a house in early 1900s', with only the name of location to go by. So far, this was a great start, I found the directory through "street and trade directories".

## Whitstable

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
